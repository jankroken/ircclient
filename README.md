# ircclient
An IRC client

This is abandonware. Ran into too many showstoppers with JavaFX to be able to implement the intended functionality of this
client. I will probably start a new irc project in a different language/framework (e.g. Swift+Cocoa, Scala + Qt bindings,..)

If you want a plain text oriented irc client, feel free to fork this project and complete it.
